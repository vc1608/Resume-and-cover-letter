Subject: Application for Software Graduate Trainee Position
<br/>

Dear Sir/Madam,
<br/>

I am writing this letter to you to apply for the position of Software Graduate Trainee in your company. I came across the position via college placements and wanted to apply for the same.
<br/>

I have studied Bachelor of Engineering (B.E.) in Information Science & Engineering from CMR Institute of Technology, Bangalore. During my time, I also pursued online certificate courses in Web Development using WordPress & Android Development. I also recently completed a 2-month internship with ByProduct Ventures LLP on Web Development where I was given tasks such as updating the website with a new theme and troubleshooting & resolving various issues or bugs on the website.
<br/>

I am a good communicator, so I enjoy working in a team and producing results as a part of the team. I also enjoy working independently as and when required of me. I'm a fast learner with good problem-solving and project management skills. I truly believe that working at your company will be an exciting and enriching experience.
<br/>

Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. More details are present in my resume. Looking forward to hearing from you.
<br/>

Thanks & Regards,  
Vishal Chauhan
